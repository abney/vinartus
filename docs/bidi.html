	<p>
	  I became interested in the problem of bidirectional processing when I
	  constructed a conversational agent (<a href="software.html">Seal.bot</a>)
	  with an automated reasoner as
	  back end, for use in a class that I teach.  Standard textbooks
	  contained familiar solutions for everything except generation - and,
	  in particular, how to reverse the complicated pipeline that leads from
	  parse tree to Clause Normal Form (CNF), which provides the basic input and
	  output for a resolution-based reasoner.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I invented my own solution, which involved short-circuiting the pipeline.
	  The idea is to use a single parse tree that
	  simultaneously represents both the (LF) structure of the English
	  sentence and the syntactic parse tree of the CNF translation.
	  (One may view this as a particularly simple instance of tree transduction.)
	  Then generation is reduced to parsing: generation is implemented by running
	  the same parser with the same grammar as in parsing, but giving it
	  the CNF words rather than the English words as input
	  [<a href="writing.html#77">77</a>].
	</p>
	<p>
	  I have collaborated with Ezra Keshet in examining the semantic
	  consequences of using CNF for translation.
	  Other next steps are to induce a large-scale grammar to drive the
	  parser/generator; to substantially extend the semantic fragment,
	  especially to generalized quantifiers; and to add
	  pragmatics.

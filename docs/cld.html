	<p>
	  A first step (!) in developing an <a href="igg.html">inductive general grammar</a> is to
	  obtain complete digital representations of a sufficiently large number
	  of languages.
	  There are publicly-availabled annotated corpora (e.g., treebanks) for 70
	  languages or so.  That represents about 1% of the world's languages,
	  and most of those 70 come from a single language family
	  (Indo-European).  One avenue toward obtaining digitizations of more
	  languages (and, by definition, of low-resource languages) is to
	  collaborate with speakers.  I have been developing software called CLD
	  that is intended to support such collaboration.

	    <a href="software.html">Seal download</a> - which includes CLD.
	    Quick start:
	    <ul>
	      <li>Untar it, call the resulting directory $seal</li>
	      <li>Put $seal/bin on your PATH, $seal/python on your PYTHONPATH</li>
	      <li>
		<code>$ cld foo.cld create_test</code> - creates two
		subdirectories in the working directory, 'foo.cld' and 'media'.
		They contain a tiny fake corpus.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<code>$ cld foo.cld</code> - starts a web server in Python at port
		8000, that writes logging information to stdout, and opens a browser
		window on localhost:8000.

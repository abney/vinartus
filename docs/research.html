	  The projects I am currently working on include:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <a href="igg.html">Inductive general grammar</a> -
	      Rethinking linguistics from the perspective of computation and data science.
	      Viewing a language as a computable bidirectional transduction between sound
	      and meaning, and general linguistics as machine learning of grammars that
	      are complete definitions of such transductions.
	    </p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <a href="cld.html">CLD</a> - To support work on inductive
	      general grammar, we require a "Universal Corpus," or at least a
	      diverse multilingual corpus.  The CLD software is designed to
	      enable language speakers to contribute directly and to provide a
	      platform for computational-linguistic research on low-resource
	      languages.
	    </p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <a href="bidi.html">Bidirectional grammars</a> -
	      With a few exceptions, the subfields of language understanding and
	      language generation have proceeded in isolation from one
	      another.  There was a burst of interest in bidirectional grammars 20
	      years ago, but it largely involved hacking logic programming
	      compilers and had limited success.  I have been exploring a simpler
	      solution.
	    </p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Semantics of improper anaphora -
	      Ezra Keshet and I have been collaborating for several
	      years now on the semantic phenomena that motivate
	      dynamic semantics, with the aim of capturing the same
	      phenomena with a simpler classic system.
	    </p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <a href="music.html">Musicolinguistics</a> -
	      applying parsing technological to music scores, in order to do
	      automatic harmonic and contrapuntal analysis.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  I am also interested in or have worked on the following topics:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>automated phonetic transcription</li>
	  <li>conversational agents</li>
	  <li>grammatical inference</li>
	  <li>spoken language systems</li>
	  <li>semisupervised learning and spectral methods</li>
	  <li>information extraction and NLP services for social science research</li>
	  <li>partial parsing and deterministic parsing</li>
	</ul>

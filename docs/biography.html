	<h3>Education</h3>
	<p>
	  In high school, I took classes in German, Spanish, and Latin, and dabbled in
	  Greek and Russian on my own.  Interest in Tolkien and constructed
	  languages led me to linguistics.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As an undergraduate, I studied classics and linguistics at Indiana
	  University, completing the B.A. in 1983.
	  I majored in Greek, and also took classes in Latin,
	  German, French, and Hebrew.  Our field methods course was on Soninke
	  (a Mande language), and I got research funding to keep working with
	  the consultant on my own during the summer [<a class="cite" href="bibliography.html#1">1</a>].
	  My senior thesis was on comparative mythology.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I received my doctorate in linguistics from MIT in 1987.  My
	  dissertation&nbsp;[<a class="cite" href="bibliography.html#6">6</a>]
	  proposed the "DP-hypothesis," which treats functional elements
	  uniformly as syntactic heads.
	</p>

	<h3>Bellcore (1987-1993)</h3>
	<p>
	  As a student, I also began working on parsing
	  [<a class="cite" href="bibliography.html#3">3</a>,<a class="cite" href="bibliography.html#4">4</a>,<a class="cite" href="bibliography.html#7">7</a>],
	  which led first to a summer internship, and then to a full-time
	  position at Bell Communications Research (Bellcore).
	  I was interested in <u>emulating human parsing</u>,
	  and my approach was to factor parse trees into &quot;<u>chunks and dependencies</u>.&quot;
	  A branch of that work was the connection between <u>syntactic structure and prosody</u>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  At Bellcore, I began studying stochastic models.  I had the good fortune to collaborate with Kevin Mark and Michael
	  Miller one summer&nbsp;[<a class="cite" href="bibliography.html#22">22</a>].
	  My contributions at the time were entirely linguistic rather than
	  mathematical, but I did absorb the idea of random fields from them.
	</p>
	
	<h3>T&uuml;bingen, Germany (1993-1997)</h3>
	<p>
	  At T&uuml;bingen, my work on chunk parsing culminated in the parser
	  called <u>Cass</u>.  Its major advantage was speed:
	  in contrast to standard chart parsers, that ran at 1-10 words per
	  second, Cass processed 10,000 words per second, allowing one to
	  parse large corpora rapidly.
	  What was missing in Cass was the
	  <u>dependencies</u> part of "chunks and
	  dependencies," and I began working
	  on <u>induction methods</u> to acquire
	  them, using Cass itself to bootstrap them from corpora,
	  in collaboration with Mats Rooth and Marc Light.
	</p>
	<p>
	  I also spent time studying random fields
	  and used them to formulate a
	  <u>probabilistic version of
	    attribute-value grammars</u>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>AT&amp;T Laboratories (1997-2002)</h3>
	<p>
	  I continued working on bootstrapping at AT&amp;T Labs.  I became
	  especially interested in <u>semisupervised learning</u>
	  and <u>boosting</u>.  I also revived my earlier work
	  on <u>prosody</u>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  My main projects, though, involved building systems:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <u>Ionaut</u>, built in collaboration with Michael Collins and
	      Amit Singhal, combined web search with entity recognition and question
	      answering.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <u>Mage</u> was a spoken dialogue system for phone-based email
	      access in which I integrated several technologies developed by other
	      groups at the Labs (speech recognition, speech synthesis, and
	      telephony control) and added natural language processing and
	      dialogue management.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <u>PreTTS</u>, built in collaboration with Don Hindle, was a
	      system for parsing and preprocessing complex email messages in order
	      to drive speech synthesis and "read" them
	      comprehensibly.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>University of Michigan (since 2002)</h3>
	<p>
	  Since coming to the University of Michigan, my major projects have
	  been:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <u>Information extraction</u>, especially in the
	      biomedical domain.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      Writing a book on <u>semisupervised learning</u>&nbsp;[<a class="cite" href="bibliography.html#62">62</a>].
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <u>Language digitization</u>, which is to say, language documentation and
	      description that supports automated processing across languages.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Linguistics graduate program</h2>
	<p>
	  If your interest is in the Linguistics doctoral program, I
	  am always happy to supervise admitted students whenever I have
	  relevant expertise. However, I do not have a lab
	  per se, nor do individual faculty members make admissions
	  decisions. In our department, the faculty as a whole
	  evaluates admission applications by consensus.  For a
	  candidate to be successful, a majority of the faculty must
	  be in favor. All are welcome to apply to the
	  program; there is information on the
	  <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics/graduates/graduate-admissions.html">department web page</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In their statements of purpose, candidates frequently
	  mention faculty members that they would like to work with,
	  and you are quite welcome to do so. An expression of
	  interest is different from an endorsement by the faculty
	  member, which is not the usual practice in our department.
	</p>

	<h2>Postdocs and visiting professors</h2>
	<p>
	  There are currently no postdoc or visiting-professor
	  positions that I am involved in. In the absence of
	  advertised positions, I unfortunately do not have anything
	  that I can offer to those seeking such positions.
	</p>

	<h2>Computer Science</h2>
	<p>
	  If your interest is in computer science, I
	  encourage you to seek out faculty members with an
	  appointment in that department. I am an affiliate of Computer
	  Science and Engineering (CSE), but that is not the same as having an
	  appointment, and I am not involved in admissions to CSE.

	<h1>Information for Applicants</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="page">

	<h2>Linguistics graduate program</h2>
	<p>
	  If your interest is in the Linguistics doctoral program, I
	  am always happy to supervise admitted students whose
	  interests align with my own. However, I do not have a lab
	  per se, nor do individual faculty members make admissions
	  decisions. In our department, the faculty as a whole
	  evaluates admission applications by consensus.  For a
	  candidate to be successful, a majority of the faculty must
	  be in favor.  You are of course very welcome to apply to the
	  program; there is information on the
	  <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics/graduates/graduate-admissions.html">department web page</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In their statements of purpose, candidates frequently
	  mention faculty members that they would like to work with,
	  and you are welcome to do so. However, it is not the
	  practice of faculty members, including myself, to endorse
	  candidates in advance.
	</p>

	<h2>Postdocs and visiting professors</h2>
	<p>
	  There are currently no postdoc or visiting-professor
	  positions that I am involved in. In the absence of any
	  advertised positions, I am unable to provide any assistance
	  to those seeking such positions.
	</p>

	<h2>Computer Science</h2>
	<p>
	  If your interest is in the Computer Science department, I'm
	  afraid I cannot help you. I do not have a position in
	  Computer Science, and though I am an affiliate, being an
	  affiliate does not authorize me to supervise Computer Science
	  students. For that reason, and given the large volume of
	  requests, inquiries about the Computer Science department
	  will not receive a response.

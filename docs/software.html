	<h3>Seal</h3>
	<p>
	  Seal is a Python library of code for computational linguistics.
	  Among other things, it contains:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Seal.bot, an end-to-end traditional language-understanding system, including
	    a resolution theorem prover as back end,
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <a href="cld.html">CLD</a>, a desktop/web application for language documentation,
	    description, and learning
	    that also provides a platform for CL research,
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    GLab, a browser-based "notebook" system for formal languages and grammar-writing
	    that I use for teaching,
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    an implementation of an oracle-driven dependency parser.
	  </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  CAUTION: this is research code and very much under active
	  development; use at your own risk.  Bugs and design flaws remain.  There are
	  some incompatible changes between one version of the software and the
	  next; code written that uses one version may need updating to work
	  with the next version.
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <a href="seal-0.20.2.tgz"><tt>seal-0.20.2.tgz</tt></a> - manual:
	    untar, then open doc/html
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Cass</h3>
	<p>
	  Cass is a partial parser that used to be available from this
	  page.  Unfortunately, it no longer compiles under current versions of gcc,
	  and fixing the problem would require a fairly substantial
	  rewrite.  If you want the old
	  tarfile, it is <a href="scol-1-12.tgz">here</a>.

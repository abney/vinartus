	<h3>Selkie</h3>
	<p>
	  <a href="https://selkie.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Selkie</a>
	  is a set of applications and a software library to
	  support language digitization, which is to say,
	  computational documentary linguistics. By documentary
	  linguistics I mean the combination of language documentation
	  and language description. Conventionally, the product of the
	  former is a corpus, and the product of the latter is a
	  grammar and lexicon. The products of language digitization
	  are electronic versions of corpus, lexicon, and grammar,
	  integrated with each other and supporting additional
	  computational functionality, such as automated
	  interpretation.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Selkie is experimental code, not a finished product. Much of
	  it is under active development and is likely to change in
	  the future. Similarly, the documentation is still in draft
	  form. I am making it publicly available to give easier
	  access to students and anyone else who may be interested. 
	</p>
	<p>
	  The two major pieces of Selkie are a corpus editor (an
	  application for documentary linguistics), and a
	  natural-language processing (NLP) pipeline. The pipeline is
	  not currently integrated into the editor, though that is
	  intended. 
	</p>

	<h3>Cass</h3>
	<p>
	  Cass is a partial parser that used to be available from this
	  page.  Unfortunately, it no longer compiles under current versions of gcc,
	  and fixing the problem would require a fairly substantial
	  rewrite.  If you want the old
	  tarfile, it is <a href="scol-1-12.tgz">here</a>.

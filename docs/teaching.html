	  The classes I teach regularly include the following.</p>
	<ul>
	  
	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <b>Ling 341, Mathematics of Language.</b> 
	      Can language be described mathematically?  Is there any fundamental
	      difference between human languages (English, Swahili,
	      Anishinaabemowin) and computer languages?  Can we build a machine
	      that genuinely speaks English?  How does one invent a language (like
	      Sindarin or Klingon) that has the ring of real language?  What is
	      Language?  Can there be a science of language?
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In answering those questions, we explore the mathematical concepts and techniques that have
	      been developed by linguists, logicians, and computer scientists to
	      model language.  The mathematical toolbox includes
	      finite-state and context-free grammars, logic, and probability
	      theory. We will focus on syntax (how sentences are put together)
	      and semantics (what they mean).
	      No mathematical background is assumed beyond high school algebra.
	      (Usually offered in the fall term.)

	      <b>Ling 441, Computational Linguistics I.</b>
	      Computational linguistics, broadly construed, encompasses three
	      distinct areas of study: (1) human language technology, including
	      machine translation, information extraction, and spoken language
	      dialogue systems, among other technologies; (2) computational models
	      of language users, which divides into computational psycholinguistics,
	      in which humans are the object of study, and natural language
	      processing as a branch of artificial intelligence, in which artificial
	      agents are the object; and (3) digital linguistics, which is the use
	      of computation in support of language documentation and linguistic
	      research.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      This class is a general introduction to computational linguistics.  We
	      will examine the levels of language processing, from low-level text processing
	      to semantic interpretation.  The
	      course assumes no computational background.  Needed programming
	      concepts and skills will be introduced as we go, using the Python programming language.
	      The textbook is Bird, Klein, and Loper,
	      <i>Natural Language Processing with Python</i> (O'Reilly, 2009, ISBN 978-0-596-51649-9).
	      (Usually offered in the fall term.)
	    </p>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    <p>
	      <b>Ling 702 - EECS 597 - SI 760, Language and Information.</b>
	      An introduction to statistical natural language
	      processing, with special emphasis on the processing of texts and text
	      collections (<i>corpora</i>).
	      The word "information" in the title is deliberately ambiguous.  It
	      refers both to the use of natural language processing to extract the
	      information that is contained in the texts, and the central importance
	      of information theory for text processing.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      There are no specific prerequisites,
	      though it will be assumed that students have at least a little prior exposure
	      to calculus, probability, vectors and matrices, and programming.
	      The textbook is Manning &amp; Sch&uuml;tze, <i>Foundations of
		Statistical Natural Language Processing</i> (MIT Press, 1999).
	      (Usually offered in the winter term.)
	    </p>

	  <li>Ling 492, Seminar: Digitizing Languages - this may get turned into a regular course offering</li>
	  <li>Ling 514, Semantics and Pragmatics</li>
	  <li>Ling 541 - EECS 595 - SI 661, Introduction to Natural Language Processing</li>
	</ul>
